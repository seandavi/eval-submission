    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/dataecosystem"
        >Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE)</a
      >
      is an effort to bring together knowledge across
      <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/">NIH Common Fund</a> programs into a
      cohesive resource.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are the Integration and Coordination Center (ICC), a center within the
      CFDE responsible for, among other things, gathering metrics for reporting
      on the impact and influence of the CFDE.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page contains instructions on how to submit your Common Fund project
      so that we can gather metrics on it and submit it to the NIH for
      evaluation as required.
    </p>

    <h2 id="submit-your-project">Submit your project</h2>

    <p>
      We gather most details about Common Fund projects automatically from NIH
      systems, but there are some pieces of info that require manual actions to
      be integrated. We&#39;ve tried to make this process as easy and automated
      as possible.
    </p>

    <h3 id="submit-software-repositories">Submit software repositories</h3>

    <p>
      Repositories ("repos") are places for storing, tracking changes to, and
      collaborating on software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, we only take submissions of software kept in
      <em>public</em> GitHub.com repos. Private repos and other platforms such
      as GitLab aren&#39;t supported yet.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Find all GitHub repos that are associated with your project.
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you&#39;re unsure where to find these, ask members of your
            project about any software that was written in support of it, and
            where the code for the software resides.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        "Tag" each repo with the project.
        <ol>
          <li>
            See
            <a
              href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics"
              >GitHub&#39;s instructions for tagging repos</a
            >
            for reference.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the main page of the repo, click on the gear ⚙ next to "About".
          </li>
          <li>
            Under "Topics", type in your
            <em>core project number</em>†, e.g.
            <code>U54OD036472</code> (case-insensitive).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/nih-cfde/icc-eval-core"
        >This repository itself</a
      >
      has been
      <a href="https://github.com/topics/u54od036472"
        >tagged with its core project number</a
      >, so use it as a reference.
    </p>

    <p>
      † Do not confuse this with a (sub) "project" number, which is longer, e.g.
      <code>1U54OD036472-01</code>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="submit-analytics">Submit analytics</h3>

    <p>
      Analytics are services that monitor traffic (number of visits over time,
      number of unique visitors, visitor demographics, etc.) on publicly
      accessible webpages.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, we only take submissions of webpages using Google Analytics.
      Other analytics services may supported in the future.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Find all Google Analytics properties that are associated with your
        project.
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you&#39;re unsure where to find these, ask members of your
            project about any webpages related to it, and if anyone set up
            analytics for them.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow us access to each property.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Go to the
            <a href="https://analytics.google.com/"
              >Google Analytics dashboard</a
            >
            and make sure you are
            <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10252712?hl=en"
              >on the right property</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            Find "Property Access Management" from the main search bar (or the
            "Admin" side menu).
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a new user with the email
            <code
              >api-access@cfde-icc-eval-core-433116.iam.gserviceaccount.com</code
            >, uncheck "Notify by email", and select the "Viewer" role.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        "Tag" each property so we can associate it with a particular project.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Find "Key Events" from the "Admin" side menu,under "Data Display".
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a new key event with the name
            <code>cfde_XXX</code> (case-insensitive), where XXX is the
            <em>core</em> project number, e.g. <code>cfde_R03OD034502</code>.
          </li>
